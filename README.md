# Process and Machine Data Analysis

This project will show you how you can automate the evaluation of any production process and machine.

You will find an detailed explanation of the project on:
https://trustmeimanengineer.de/en/german-engineering-en/production-applications/process-and-machine-data-analysis/ 

You will be able to automatically evaluate key figures like throughput, up-time, idle-time or energy consumption of every production machine or utility equipment like compressors, boilers, chiller.
You will also be able to automatically evaluate key figures like process time or product quality of every production process.

Since I started the project I've spend a lot of time to learn coding and at this point I'm aware of the bad coding style of the project.
I uploaded it anyway, because it works and I'm sure that it can be very useful.
It will be a huge help if you apply it in your production, but you should definitely be careful to NOT take this as an example of how to write code!
